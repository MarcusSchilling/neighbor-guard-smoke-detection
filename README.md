ðŸ”¥ NeighborGuard: Smart Smoke Detection & Air Quality Prediction ðŸ”¥

**Overview:**
NeighborGuard is an innovative and proactive GitHub project aimed at providing a reliable solution to prevent disturbances caused by neighbors' smoking habits. By leveraging advanced microcontroller technology integrated with a smoke detector, NeighborGuard not only alerts you promptly when smoke is detected but also empowers you to predict optimal times for ventilation (lÃ¼ften) in the future.

**Key Features:**

ðŸš€ **Real-time Smoke Detection:** NeighborGuard utilizes state-of-the-art smoke detection algorithms and a highly sensitive sensor, ensuring timely and accurate detection of smoke occurrences.

ðŸ“± **Instant Notifications:** Receive immediate alerts on your smartphone or connected device the moment smoke is detected in your vicinity. Never worry about smoke-related inconveniences again!

ðŸ“ˆ **Air Quality Prediction:** With NeighborGuard's cutting-edge machine learning capabilities, it learns from historical data to predict optimal windows for ventilation, enabling you to maintain a smoke-free environment proactively.

ðŸ’¾ **Data Logging & Analysis:** NeighborGuard can log all sensor data, allowing you to analyze trends and gain insights into your air quality over time.
